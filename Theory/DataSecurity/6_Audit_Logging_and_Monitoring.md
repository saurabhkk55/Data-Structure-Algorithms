6. Audit Logging and Monitoring
- Implement logging for critical actions (e.g., login attempts, data access) and ensure that sensitive
  data is not logged in plaintext.
- Set up real-time monitoring and alerting systems for detecting unauthorized access or
  suspicious activities.

### Explaination

### **Audit Logging and Monitoring**:
Audit logging and monitoring are essential for tracking and responding to suspicious activities in your application. By logging critical actions and setting up monitoring systems, you can detect unauthorized access, track malicious activities, and ensure that sensitive data is protected.

### Key Points:
1. **Logging Critical Actions**:
    - Log important events like login attempts, user actions, data access, and administrative changes.
    - Ensure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) is **never logged** in plaintext to avoid accidental exposure.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting**:
    - Set up systems that monitor logs in real-time to detect suspicious or unauthorized access.
    - Use alerting mechanisms to notify system administrators about potential threats (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, accessing sensitive data without authorization).

### Simple Explanation with Code Example:

#### 1. **Logging Critical Actions**:

Here, we use **Spring Boot’s logging** capabilities to log critical actions, such as login attempts, without exposing sensitive data.

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Service
public class UserService {
    // Creating a logger instance
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    // Example method for login
    public boolean login(String username, String password) {
        // Log the login attempt (but never log the password)
        logger.info("Login attempt for username: {}", username);

        // Simulating the login process
        boolean isSuccessful = authenticate(username, password);

        if (isSuccessful) {
            logger.info("Login successful for username: {}", username);
        } else {
            logger.warn("Failed login attempt for username: {}", username);
        }

        return isSuccessful;
    }

    private boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        // Simulate authentication logic here (using password comparison)
        return "correct_password".equals(password);  // Just an example, don't use plain comparison in real-world apps!
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Logging**: Here, we use SLF4J to log the actions. When a user tries to log in, we log an **INFO** level message for a successful login or a **WARN** level message for a failed login attempt.
- **Sensitive Data**: Notice that the password is **never logged**, ensuring that sensitive data like passwords are protected.

#### 2. **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting**:

Real-time monitoring and alerting can be set up using **Spring Boot Actuator** combined with **external monitoring tools** like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** or **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

**Example** of monitoring login attempts in real time:
- **Prometheus** can be set up to scrape metrics from your Spring Boot application.
- **Spring Boot Actuator** can expose metrics and health information that can be monitored.

**Spring Boot Actuator** Example:

```xml
<!-- Add dependency in pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

In the application properties file, enable the metrics and health endpoints:
```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,metrics
```

Now, your application will expose metrics, such as:
- Health status (`/actuator/health`)
- Metrics like the number of failed login attempts (`/actuator/metrics`)

#### 3. **Setting Up Alerts**:

You can use tools like **Prometheus and Grafana** to set up **real-time monitoring** and **alerting**.

For example, if you want to monitor **failed login attempts** and trigger an alert if there are more than 5 failed attempts in a given time period, you could set up the following in **Prometheus**:

1. **Track Login Attempts**: Modify your code to expose the number of failed login attempts as a metric.
2. **Create a Prometheus Query**:
    - For example, `failed_logins_total` would be the metric exposed by your application.
3. **Alert in Grafana**: Use Grafana to display the metric and set up an **alert** if the failed login attempts exceed a threshold.

```yaml
# Example Prometheus alert rule
groups:
  - name: authentication
    rules:
      - alert: HighFailedLoginAttempts
        expr: failed_logins_total{job="your-app"} > 5
        for: 1m
        annotations:
          summary: "High number of failed login attempts"
```

When the threshold is breached (e.g., more than 5 failed login attempts in 1 minute), **Prometheus** will send an alert to your monitoring system, and **Grafana** can display the alert in real-time.

### Why It’s Important:
- **Audit Logging** helps track what actions are happening in your application. It allows administrators to **review logs** in case of issues, like a data breach, and take corrective actions.
- **Monitoring and Alerting** help detect **suspicious activities** in real-time. For example, if an attacker is attempting to brute-force passwords or access sensitive data, these systems will alert you instantly, allowing you to respond quickly.

### Summary:
- **Audit Logging** is crucial for tracking critical actions (like login attempts) and ensuring no sensitive data is logged.
- **Real-Time Monitoring** helps detect malicious activities, and **alerting** systems notify you when things go wrong, so you can take action right away.
