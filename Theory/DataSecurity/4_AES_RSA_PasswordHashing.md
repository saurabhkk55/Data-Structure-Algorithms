### Question 1: 

Do we use `AES` and `Password Hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)` both for storing passord securely in our database? If we have use only 1 then which one is more prefferable?

### Answer 1: 

No, **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** and **Password Hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)** serve different purposes, and we typically do **not** use both for storing passwords securely. Let me explain:

---

### **1. Password Hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)**
- **Purpose**: Hashing is designed specifically for password security.
- **How It Works**:
    - Converts a password into a fixed-length, irreversible hash.
    - Uses a **salt** (random data) to ensure the same password always produces a different hash.
    - Hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 are computationally expensive, making them resistant to brute-force attacks.
- **Reversibility**: Irreversible. You cannot derive the original password from its hash.
- **Usage**:
    - The user enters a password.
    - You hash the entered password and compare it with the stored hash in the database.
- **Advantages**:
    - Specifically designed for passwords.
    - Resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
    - Simple and effective for password validation.

---

### **2. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
- **Purpose**: AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed for securing data in transit or storage, not passwords.
- **How It Works**:
    - Encrypts data using a key.
    - To retrieve the original data, you need the same key to decrypt it.
- **Reversibility**: Reversible. Encrypted data can be decrypted if the key is available.
- **Usage**:
    - Securing sensitive data like credit card details or personal information in databases.
    - Protecting data during transmission (e.g., TLS uses AES for encryption).
- **Disadvantages for Passwords**:
    - Storing passwords as encrypted data means you must store the encryption key securely.
    - If the encryption key is compromised, all encrypted passwords are exposed.

---

### **Why Password Hashing Is Preferable Over AES for Storing Passwords**
1. **Irreversibility**: Hashing algorithms are one-way, meaning even if an attacker gains access to the database, they cannot reverse the hash to retrieve the original password. AES, on the other hand, is reversible, which increases risk if the key is leaked.

2. **Password Validation**: Hashing is ideal for password validation because you don’t need to know the original password, only compare the hashes.

3. **Purpose-Specific**: Hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 are specifically designed for passwords, incorporating features like salting and computational cost.

### **When Should AES Be Used?**
AES is suitable for encrypting other types of sensitive data, such as:
- Credit card numbers.
- Social security numbers.
- Medical records.

---

### **Conclusion**
If you need to store passwords securely, use **password hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2**.
- **Do not use AES for passwords** as its reversibility introduces unnecessary risks.
- **Best choice**: **Argon2**, as it is the most secure and modern hashing algorithm, followed by bcrypt or scrypt if Argon2 is unavailable.

By using hashing, you ensure that even in the event of a database compromise, the attackers face significant difficulty in cracking passwords.

### Question 2: 

Ok, so first we encrypt the data using AES or RSA encryption mechanism and then we can this encrypted data over the internet with TLS to make it more secure, is it correct?

### Answer 2: 

Yes, your understanding is **correct**! Let me break it down step by step for clarity:

---

### **1. Encrypting Data with AES or RSA**
- **Purpose**: Protect the **data** itself, ensuring it is secure even if intercepted or stolen during storage or transit.
- **How It Works**:
    - Use **AES** (symmetric encryption) or **RSA** (asymmetric encryption) to encrypt sensitive data (e.g., personal information, credit card numbers).
    - This ensures that only those with the proper decryption key can access the original data.
- **AES vs. RSA**:
    - **AES** is fast and suitable for large amounts of data. It uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
    - **RSA** is slower and used for small amounts of data (e.g., encrypting AES keys) or where public/private key pairs are needed.

---

### **2. Securing Data in Transit with TLS**
- **Purpose**: Protect the **communication channel** over the internet, ensuring data is not intercepted, tampered with, or read by unauthorized parties.
- **How TLS Works**:
    - Establishes a secure, encrypted connection between the client (e.g., browser) and the server.
    - Uses **RSA** or **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for key exchange and **AES** for encrypting the actual data transmitted.
    - Also ensures the **authenticity** of the server using certificates (e.g., HTTPS uses TLS with certificates).

---

### **Combined Workflow** (Encryption + TLS)
Here’s how encryption (e.g., AES) and TLS work together for secure data transmission:

1. **Encrypt Data with AES**:
    - Before sending sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), encrypt it using AES to protect the data itself.

2. **Send Encrypted Data Over TLS**:
    - Establish a **TLS-secured connection** between the client and the server.
    - Transmit the encrypted data through this secure channel.
    - Even if someone intercepts the data, they would need to bypass TLS and then decrypt the AES-encrypted data.

3. **Decrypt Data on the Server**:
    - The server receives the AES-encrypted data.
    - It uses the **decryption key** to decrypt it back into its original form for processing.

---

### **Benefits of This Approach**
- **Double Security**: Even if the communication channel (TLS) is compromised, the data remains safe due to AES encryption.
- **Mitigation of Risks**:
    - TLS protects against eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.
    - AES encryption ensures data is unreadable even if intercepted or stored insecurely.
- **End-to-End Security**: Combines strong encryption and secure transport.

---

### **Example Workflow**
#### Data Flow from Client to Server:
1. **Client Side**:
    - Data (e.g., credit card details) → **AES encryption** → Encrypted data.
    - Encrypted data → **Sent over TLS-secured channel**.

2. **Server Side**:
    - Data received → **Decrypted by TLS** → Encrypted data (AES-encrypted payload).
    - Encrypted data → **AES decryption** → Original data.

---

### **Conclusion**
Encrypting sensitive data using **AES/RSA** before transmission and then using **TLS** to secure the communication channel is a **best practice** for end-to-end data protection. This layered security ensures that even if one mechanism is compromised, the data remains protected.
