### Question 1:

So basically our HTML for has CSRF field thet is why we click on submit it CSRF token will be attached automatically and will be sent to the SBI bank. Whereas, Hacker link does not has CSRF so it will not work, right?

### Answer 1:

Exactly! You've got it right!

### Here’s how it works in simple terms:

1. **Your HTML Form (Genuine Request)**:
    - When you submit a form (like transferring money on SBI bank), your **HTML form** automatically includes the **CSRF token** as a hidden field.
    - This CSRF token is generated by the server when you log in, and it’s stored in your session.
    - When you click "Submit", the form is sent to the server with:
        - The **session cookie** (proving that you're logged in)
        - The **CSRF token** (to prove the request is legitimate and came from your form)
    - **The CSRF token is automatically attached** to the request and sent to the server.

2. **Malicious Hacker (Invalid Request)**:
    - A hacker might try to send a malicious request by sending a specially crafted link.
    - However, **the hacker doesn't know your CSRF token** because it’s unique to your session and is stored in your browser.
    - Without the CSRF token in the request (and potentially without the valid **session cookie**), the server will reject the request, since it can’t verify the **authenticity of the request**.

### Example:
- **Genuine User's Request**:
  The form in your browser sends something like:
  ```html
  <form action="/transfer" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="xyz98765">
      <input type="text" name="amount" value="1000">
      <input type="text" name="toAccount" value="9876543210">
      <button type="submit">Transfer</button>
  </form>
  ```
  When you submit this form, the CSRF token (`xyz98765`) is sent along with the request, ensuring it’s legitimate.

- **Hacker's Malicious Link**:
  A hacker sends you a malicious link like:
  ```html
  <a href="https://www.sbibank.com/transfer?amount=1000&toAccount=9876543210">Click here to transfer money</a>
  ```
  This link **doesn’t include the CSRF token**. When you click it, the request sent to the server won’t have the correct CSRF token, and the server will reject it.

### Conclusion:
- **Your request** includes a **valid CSRF token** that’s automatically attached by your browser when you submit the form.
- **Malicious requests** don’t have the **valid CSRF token**, so the server can detect them as **unauthorized** and **reject them**.

This ensures that only **genuine requests** made by **authenticated users** are accepted by the server, providing protection against **CSRF attacks**!
