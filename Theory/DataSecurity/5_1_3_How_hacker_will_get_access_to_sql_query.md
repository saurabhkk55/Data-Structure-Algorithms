### Question 1:

How hacker will get access to the sql query? Explain meaning of abstract here.

### Answer 1:

In a typical **SQL Injection** attack, the hacker doesn't need direct access to the SQL query itself. Instead, they **exploit vulnerabilities in the application** to manipulate the query by injecting malicious input through user input fields (like a login form, search bar, or any other form where the application directly uses user input in SQL queries).

Here's how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability:

### 1. **Exploiting the Input Field**
The attacker can try to **inject malicious SQL code** into any user input field that is **directly incorporated into SQL queries without validation or sanitization**. Common targets include:
- **Login forms** (username and password)
- **Search bars**
- **Contact forms**
- **URLs** (in case of query parameters like `?id=123`)

In the case of a login form, the hacker might input something like this:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `' OR '1'='1`

### 2. **How the Injection Works**
The SQL query used by the application may look something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user_input_username' AND password = 'user_input_password';
```

If the application directly inserts user input into this SQL query without validating or sanitizing it, the hacker can manipulate the query by injecting malicious SQL code into the input fields. In this example:

- The hacker types **`' OR '1'='1`** in the **password** field.
- This modifies the query to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';
```

The part `OR '1'='1'` always evaluates as **true** (since `1` is always equal to `1`), making the entire `password` condition irrelevant. The result is that the hacker **bypasses the password check** and is granted access as long as the username exists in the database.

### 3. **How the Hacker Finds the Vulnerability**
The attacker may **try different inputs** in the form fields to see if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. They might start by entering common malicious payloads, such as:

- `' OR '1'='1`
- `' UNION SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users --`
- `' OR 1=1 --`

If the application is vulnerable, the SQL query will break or behave in unexpected ways, and the attacker can use these clues to understand how to manipulate the query.

### 4. **What Happens After the Injection?**
Once the hacker successfully injects the malicious SQL code, they can do a number of things depending on the level of access they have:

- **Bypass Authentication**: As in the login example, the attacker can log in without knowing the password.
- **Access Sensitive Data**: The attacker can retrieve sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, or email addresses) from the database.
- **Modify Data**: The attacker might be able to insert, update, or delete data in the database.
- **Execute Commands**: In some cases, the attacker might be able to execute other SQL commands or even interact with the database server itself.

### 5. **How the Hacker Doesn't Need Direct Access to the Query**
The hacker doesn't need direct access to the SQL query. Instead, they exploit the **application's inability to properly handle user input**. The application is the one constructing and executing the SQL query, and the hacker simply provides **crafted input** that breaks the intended structure of the query.

For example, if the application doesn't **parameterize** or **sanitize** the input, the hacker can manipulate the query by adding SQL logic to the input fields. The hacker doesn't need to see the full SQL query; they just need to understand how the application constructs and executes the query.

---

### **Summary of How the Hacker Gets Access:**
1. **Hacker identifies a vulnerable input field**: The hacker looks for places where user input is directly used in SQL queries, such as login forms or search bars.
2. **Hacker injects malicious SQL**: The hacker provides input like `' OR '1'='1` in the password field or uses other malicious strings designed to alter the query logic.
3. **The application executes the manipulated query**: The application, without proper validation or sanitization, runs the malicious query against the database.
4. **Hacker gains unauthorized access**: Depending on the nature of the SQL injection, the attacker might bypass authentication, access sensitive data, or even perform destructive actions on the database.

### **How to Prevent It?**
- **Use Prepared Statements**: Always use parameterized queries where the user input is treated as data, not executable code.
- **Use ORM Libraries**: Tools like Hibernate, which automatically use prepared statements, help prevent SQL injection.
- **Validate and Sanitize Input**: Ensure that user input is validated (e.g., check for expected patterns) and sanitized (e.g., escape special characters).
- **Limit Database Permissions**: Restrict database access by the application, so even if an injection occurs, the attacker has limited access.

By ensuring the proper handling of user input, you can protect against SQL injection and other similar attacks.
