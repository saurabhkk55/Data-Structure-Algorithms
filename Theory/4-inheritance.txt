Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}
The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

Types of inheritance in java
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single(parent_A <- child_parent_A), multilevel(parent_A <- child_parent_A <- child_child_parent_A) and hierarchical(parent_A <- first_child_parent_A, parent_A <- second_child_parent_A).
In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only. We will learn about interfaces later.
