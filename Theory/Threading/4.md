# `Different Implementations of ExecutorService`:

1. **ThreadPoolExecutor:**
   - The most flexible and commonly used implementation of `ExecutorService`.
   - Manages a pool of worker threads to execute submitted tasks.
   - Configurable in terms of `core pool size, maximum pool size, keep-alive time for idle threads, and the task queue`.

2. **ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor:**
   - Extends `ThreadPoolExecutor` to schedule tasks to run after a delay or periodically.
   - Implements `ScheduledExecutorService`.
   - Useful for recurring tasks or delayed task execution.

3. **ForkJoinPool:**
   - Implements the `ExecutorService` interface but is optimized for tasks that can be split into smaller tasks recursively (`work-stealing algorithm`).
   - Commonly used in `parallel programming` and tasks that involve large-scale recursive operations.

4. **SingleThreadExecutor:**
   - An executor that uses a single worker thread to execute tasks sequentially.
   - Ensures that tasks are executed one at a time, in the order they are submitted.

5. **CachedThreadPool:**
   - A pool with an unlimited number of threads.
   - Threads are reused if available, or new ones are created when needed.
   - Suitable for short-lived, bursty tasks.

### `ThreadPoolExecutor in Detail`:

ThreadPoolExecutor is a highly configurable implementation of ExecutorService. It allows you to control various aspects of thread pool behavior, such as the number of threads, queue management, and thread termination.

### `Key Parameters of ThreadPoolExecutor`:
1. **Core Pool Size:**
   - The minimum number of threads that will always remain active, even if they are idle.
   - These threads are not terminated until `shutdown()` is called.

2. **Maximum Pool Size:**
   - The maximum number of threads that can be active at a time.
   - If all core threads are busy and the task queue is full, only then, new threads are created up to this maximum limit.

3. **Keep-Alive Time:**
   - The time for which idle threads (above the core pool size) are allowed to wait for new tasks before they are terminated.

4. **Task Queue (BlockingQueue<Runnable>):**
   - Used to store tasks before they are executed.
   - Several types of queues can be used:
     - **`SynchronousQueue`:** No storage, tasks are handed off to threads directly.
     - **`LinkedBlockingQueue`:** An unbounded queue where tasks wait if no threads are available.
     - **`ArrayBlockingQueue`:** A bounded queue with a fixed capacity.

5. **RejectedExecutionHandler:**
   - Handles tasks that cannot be executed due to resource limitations (e.g., maximum pool size reached).
   - Four built-in policies:
     - **AbortPolicy:** Throws RejectedExecutionException.
     - **DiscardPolicy:** Discards the task silently.
     - **DiscardOldestPolicy:** Discards the oldest unprocessed task in the queue.
     - **CallerRunsPolicy:** The task is executed by the calling thread.

### `Example of ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExecutorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with custom settings
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                2,       // corePoolSize
                5,       // maximumPoolSize
                1,       // keepAliveTime
                TimeUnit.SECONDS,  // time unit for keepAliveTime
                new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(3), // task queue with a capacity of 3
                new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // Rejection policy
        );

        // 2. Submit tasks to the executor
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = new Task(i);
            executor.execute(task);
        }

        // 3. Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    // Custom Runnable task
    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private int taskId;

        public Task(int taskId) {
            this.taskId = taskId;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running on Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(20000); // Simulate a long-running task
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### `Explanation of the Example`:

New threads will be created in the thread pool when the **core threads are all busy** and the **task queue is full**, but there are still more tasks to be executed. Let's break down when exactly a new thread will be created, given the configuration of your `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

#### `Configuration Recap`:
- **Core Pool Size**: 2 threads (these are always created first).
- **Maximum Pool Size**: 5 threads (can go up to 5, including the core threads).
- **Task Queue**: LinkedBlockingQueue with a capacity of 3.
- **Rejection Policy**: `CallerRunsPolicy` (when both the pool and the queue are full, the calling thread executes the task).

#### `Thread Creation Process`:
1. **Initial Task Submission (Up to Core Pool Size)**:
   - The pool will immediately create and start **up to 2 core threads** (`corePoolSize = 2`).
   - These core threads will start executing tasks immediately.

2. **Task Queueing**:
   - Once the 2 core threads are busy executing tasks, any additional tasks (up to 3) will be placed into the **LinkedBlockingQueue** (since its capacity is 3).
   - No new threads will be created yet because tasks are still being queued.

3. **New Thread Creation (Exceeding Core Pool Size and Full Queue)**:
   - Once the **task queue is full** (3 tasks queued) and the **core threads are still busy**, the pool will create **new threads** (beyond the core pool, up to the `maximumPoolSize = 5`).
   - New threads will be created and used to execute tasks only **if the queue is full** and **there are still more tasks to process**.
   
4. **Thread Creation Conditions**:
   - A new thread (beyond the core threads) will be created **only if**:
     - The core threads are all busy.
     - The task queue is full.
   - As new threads are created, the pool can grow **up to 5 threads total** (`maximumPoolSize`).
   
5. **Rejection Policy**:
   - If the pool is already at the **maximumPoolSize** (5 threads) and the queue is full, any new tasks will trigger the rejection policy (in this case, the `CallerRunsPolicy`, which makes the calling thread handle the task).

6. **Shutdown:**
   - The `shutdown()` method ensures that no new tasks are accepted, and the executor will terminate after all tasks are completed.

### `Some sample outputs`:

#### `Output 1`:
```java
Task 1 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 7 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
Task 8 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-5
Task 6 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-3
Task 9 is running on Thread: main
Task 2 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-5
Task 10 is running on Thread: main
Task 4 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 5 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
```

#### `Output 2`:
```java
Task 6 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-3
Task 2 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-2
Task 1 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 9 is running on Thread: main
Task 7 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
Task 8 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-5
Task 10 is running on Thread: main
Task 3 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-3
Task 4 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
Task 5 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
```

#### `Output 3`:
```java
Task 9 is running on Thread: main
Task 8 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-5
Task 2 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-2
Task 6 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-3
Task 7 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
Task 1 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 10 is running on Thread: main
Task 3 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-5
Task 4 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-4
Task 5 is running on Thread: pool-1-thread-1
```

We can observe one thing here which is `Task 9` & `Task 10` always executed by main thread (explanation is already above).
