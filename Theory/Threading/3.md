# `ExecutorService`

1. **`Introduction`:**
   - ExecutorService is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package.
   - It is an interface for managing and controlling asynchronous task execution.
   - It provides methods for handling the `lifecycle of tasks, including task submission, execution, and termination`.

2. **`Thread Management`:**
   - It abstracts the creation and management of threads, eliminating the need to manually create and control threads.
   - Tasks are submitted to the ExecutorService, and it manages the execution using a pool of worker threads.

3. **`Task Submission`:**
   - Tasks can be submitted using methods like `execute(Runnable) and submit(Runnable/Callable)`.
   - `execute()` runs tasks without returning a result, while `submit()` can return a Future object representing the result or status of the task.

4. **`Thread Pool`:**
   - `ExecutorService` can use different thread pools (e.g., `fixed-size thread pool, cached thread pool, single-threaded pool`).
   - Thread pools manage a collection of threads that can be reused to execute tasks, improving performance and resource management.

5. **`Shutting Down`:**
   - It provides two ways to shut down the service:
     - `shutdown()`: No new tasks are accepted, but already submitted tasks are completed.
     - `shutdownNow()`: Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks.

6. **`Future Interface`:**
   - When tasks are submitted using `submit()`, they return a Future object, allowing you to:
     - Check if the task is complete (`isDone()`).
     - Cancel the task (`cancel()`).
     - Retrieve the result (`get()`).

7. **`Concurrency Control`:**
   - It provides better concurrency control as compared to manually creating threads.
   - It minimizes overhead by reusing existing threads and allows multiple tasks to run concurrently.

### `Example: ExecutorService with Fixed Thread Pool`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // 2. Submit tasks to the ExecutorService
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            Runnable task = new Task(i);
            executor.submit(task); // Submit the task for execution
        }

        // 3. Shutdown the ExecutorService
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    // Custom Runnable task
    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private int taskId;

        public Task(int taskId) {
            this.taskId = taskId;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running on Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
```

### `Explanation of Example`:
1. **Creating a Thread Pool:**
   - `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)` creates a pool with 3 threads.
   
2. **Submitting Tasks:**
   - The loop submits 5 tasks (Task objects) to the executor.
   - Each task runs on one of the 3 available threads.
   
3. **Shutting Down:**
   - After submitting all tasks, `shutdown()` is called to stop accepting new tasks.

### `Key Points to Remember`:
- **Thread Pools:** Efficiently manage threads.
- **Task Submission Methods:** execute() for no result, submit() for results.
- **Shutdown Mechanisms:** shutdown() and shutdownNow().
- **Future Object:** Allows checking task status and retrieving results asynchronously.
