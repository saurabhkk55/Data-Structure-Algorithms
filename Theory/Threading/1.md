# 1. `Producer-Consumer problem`
The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical example of a multi-threading scenario where two types of threads, **`Producer`** and **`Consumer`**, share a common **`buffer (ex: data structure like ArrayList)`**. 

The Producer generates data and puts it into the buffer, while the Consumer takes the data from the buffer for processing. The key challenge is to synchronize access to the buffer so that:

- The **`Producer`** should not add data if the buffer is full.
- The **`Consumer`** should not consume data if the buffer is empty.
- Both need to access the buffer in a thread-safe manner to avoid race conditions.

### Solution using Java's `wait()` and `notify()`

We can solve this using Java's built-in synchronization mechanisms like `wait()` and `notify()`.

Here's an implementation of the Producer-Consumer problem:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class Buffer {
    private final int MAX_CAPACITY;
    private Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    public Buffer(int size) {
        this.MAX_CAPACITY = size;
    }

    // Producer adds items to the buffer
    public synchronized void produce(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.size() == MAX_CAPACITY) {
            // Wait if the buffer is full
            wait();
        }
        queue.add(value);
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        // Notify the consumer that there's something to consume
        notify();
    }

    // Consumer removes items from the buffer
    public synchronized int consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (queue.isEmpty()) {
            // Wait if the buffer is empty
            wait();
        }
        int value = queue.remove();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
        // Notify the producer that there is space in the buffer
        notify();
        return value;
    }
}

// Producer thread
class Producer implements Runnable {
    private Buffer buffer;

    public Producer(Buffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        int value = 0;
        try {
            while (true) {
                buffer.produce(value++);
                Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate time taken to produce
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

// Consumer thread
class Consumer implements Runnable {
    private Buffer buffer;

    public Consumer(Buffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                buffer.consume();
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time taken to consume
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

// Main class to run the example
public class ProducerConsumerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Buffer buffer = new Buffer(5); // Buffer size of 5

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(buffer));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(buffer));

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```

### Key Points in the Code:
- **Buffer Class**: 
  - It manages a queue with a fixed capacity.
  - The `produce()` method adds items to the queue, but only if there's space.
  - The `consume()` method removes items from the queue, but only if it's not empty.
  - Both methods are `synchronized`, ensuring only one thread can access them at a time.
  - `wait()` is called when the buffer is full (for the producer) or empty (for the consumer).
  - `notify()` wakes up waiting threads when a condition (full/empty buffer) is resolved.
  
- **Producer and Consumer Classes**:
  - These implement `Runnable`, meaning they can be run on separate threads.
  - The Producer generates values and puts them into the buffer, while the Consumer takes values from the buffer.

- **Main Class**:
  - Two threads are started: one for the producer and one for the consumer.

### Output (example):
```
Produced: 0
Consumed: 0
Produced: 1
Produced: 2
Consumed: 1
Produced: 3
Consumed: 2
...
```

# 2. `Thread Priority`

In Java, each thread has a priority that determines the order in which threads are scheduled by the thread scheduler. The priority is an integer value between 1 (MIN_PRIORITY) and 10 (MAX_PRIORITY), with 5 being the default (NORM_PRIORITY).

In general, a thread with a higher priority is more likely to be chosen for execution over threads with lower priority, but it doesn't guarantee it, as the actual thread scheduling depends on the underlying operating systemâ€™s thread scheduler.

**`Setting and Getting Thread Priority`**

You can set the priority of a thread using the `setPriority()` method and get the current priority using the `getPriority()` method:
```java
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
int priority = thread.getPriority();
```

If you try to set a priority outside the valid range (1-10), an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

**`Example`**
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " Priority: " + this.getPriority());
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread("High Priority Thread");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread("Low Priority Thread");

        t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Priority 10
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY); // Priority 1

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

**`Output could be something like`**:

```text
High Priority Thread Priority: 10
High Priority Thread Priority: 10
Low Priority Thread Priority: 1
High Priority Thread Priority: 10
Low Priority Thread Priority: 1
Low Priority Thread Priority: 1
...
```

# 3. `ReentrantLock`

The `ReentrantLock` class implements the `Lock` interface, which is part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.

`ReentrantLock` is a class in Java that implements the `Lock` interface, providing a more flexible and powerful mechanism for thread synchronization compared to the traditional `synchronized` keyword. It allows threads to acquire locks on shared resources in a reentrant manner, meaning that a thread can enter a lock it already holds without causing a deadlock.

**`Key Features of ReentrantLock`**

1. **Reentrancy**: 
   - A thread that holds a `ReentrantLock` can re-acquire the same lock multiple times. Each time it acquires the lock, an internal counter is incremented. The lock is only released when the counter reaches zero, which occurs after the same number of unlock calls.

2. **Fairness**: 
   - The constructor of `ReentrantLock` accepts an optional boolean parameter that specifies whether the lock should be fair. If set to `true`, threads are granted access to the lock in the order they requested it (FIFO). If set to `false`, there is no guarantee on the order of access, which may lead to starvation of some threads.

3. **Explicit Locking and Unlocking**:
   - Unlike `synchronized`, which automatically locks and unlocks, ReentrantLock requires `manual locking & unlocking` by the programmer. This gives more control but also adds responsibility to ensure locks are released correctly. 

4. **Interruptible Lock Acquisition**: 
   - `ReentrantLock` allows threads to be interrupted while waiting for a lock. This means that if a thread is blocked waiting for a lock, it can be interrupted and will throw an `InterruptedException`. unlike a synchronized block where thread cannot be interrupted while waiting to enter the block.

5. **Lock with Timeout**: 
   - ReentrantLock allows you to try acquiring the lock for a specified time period. This is useful if you want to avoid waiting indefinitely for a lock.

6. **Condition Variables**: 
   - `ReentrantLock` provides support for condition variables through its `Condition` class, allowing threads to wait for certain conditions to be met before proceeding. This is useful for implementing complex thread coordination mechanisms.

**`Example`**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is trying to acquire the lock.");
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has acquired the lock.");
            count++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " incremented count to: " + count);
        } finally {
            // Importnat: Unlock happens inside finally block only
            lock.unlock(); // Ensure the lock is released
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has released the lock.");
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class IncrementThread extends Thread {
    private Counter counter;

    public IncrementThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create multiple threads to increment the counter
        IncrementThread t1 = new IncrementThread(counter);
        IncrementThread t2 = new IncrementThread(counter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

**`Sample output`**:

```java
Thread-0 is trying to acquire the lock.
Thread-0 has acquired the lock.
Thread-0 incremented count to: 1
Thread-0 has released the lock.
Thread-1 is trying to acquire the lock.
Thread-1 has acquired the lock.
Thread-1 incremented count to: 2
Thread-1 has released the lock.
Thread-0 is trying to acquire the lock.
Thread-0 has acquired the lock.
Thread-0 incremented count to: 3
Thread-0 has released the lock.
Thread-1 is trying to acquire the lock.
Thread-1 has acquired the lock.
Thread-1 incremented count to: 4
Thread-1 has released the lock.
...
Final count: 2000
```

# 4. **`ReadWriteLock`**

ReadWriteLock is an interface & part of the **`java.util.concurrent.locks`** package and is designed to handle scenarios where multiple threads can read a resource simultaneously, but only one thread can write to it at a time.

### **`Key Concept of ReadWriteLock`**:

- **`Multiple readers, single writer`**: 
  - Multiple threads can **acquire the read lock simultaneously** as long as no thread holds the write lock.
  - Only one thread can **acquire the write lock** at any given time, and while the write lock is held, no thread can hold the read lock.
  
This lock improves performance by allowing **concurrent read access** in situations where write operations are less frequent, reducing contention between reading threads.

### **`ReadWriteLock Interface Methods`**:

The **`ReadWriteLock`** interface provides two main methods to acquire locks:

1. **`Lock readLock()`**: Returns the lock used for reading. Multiple threads can hold the read lock simultaneously as long as no thread holds the write lock.
   
   ```java
   Lock readLock = readWriteLock.readLock();
   readLock.lock();  // Acquire read lock
   ```

2. **`Lock writeLock()`**: Returns the lock used for writing. Only one thread can hold the write lock, and it excludes all other read and write locks.
   
   ```java
   Lock writeLock = readWriteLock.writeLock();
   writeLock.lock();  // Acquire write lock
   ```

### **`Key Features of ReadWriteLock`**:
1. **Concurrent Read Access**: Multiple threads can read concurrently, improving performance when reads are more frequent than writes.
2. **Exclusive Write Access**: Write operations block all other threads (both readers and writers) to ensure data consistency.
3. **Reentrant Behavior**: If using `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, a thread that holds the read or write lock can re-acquire the lock without getting blocked.
4. **Fair Lock Option**: `ReentrantReadWriteLock` can be configured for **fairness**, ensuring that threads are granted the lock in the order they requested it.

### Common Implementation: `ReentrantReadWriteLock`

The most commonly used class that implements `ReadWriteLock` is **`ReentrantReadWriteLock`**, which is also part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package. It provides the functionality of a `ReadWriteLock` with **reentrant behavior**, meaning that a thread holding a lock can acquire it again without blocking.

### `Example`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class ReadWriteLockExample {

    private int sharedResource = 0;
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    // Method to read the shared resource
    public int readResource() {
        lock.readLock().lock();  // Acquire read lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is reading: " + sharedResource);
            return sharedResource;
        } finally {
            // Always release the lock in the finally block
            lock.readLock().unlock();  // Release the read lock
        }
    }

    // Method to write/update the shared resource
    public void writeResource(int value) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();  // Acquire write lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is writing: " + value);
            sharedResource = value;
        } finally {
            // Always release the lock in the finally block
            lock.writeLock().unlock();  // Release the write lock
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReadWriteLockExample example = new ReadWriteLockExample();
        
        // Thread for reading
        Runnable readTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.readResource();
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        };

        // Thread for writing
        Runnable writeTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 5; i < 10; i++) {
                example.writeResource(i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(200);  // Simulate some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        };

        // Creating threads
        Thread readThread1 = new Thread(readTask, "Reader 1");
        Thread readThread2 = new Thread(readTask, "Reader 2");
        Thread writeThread = new Thread(writeTask, "Writer");

        // Starting threads
        readThread1.start();
        readThread2.start();
        writeThread.start();
    }
}
```

**`Explanation`**:
- The `readResource()` method acquires the **read lock** (`lock.readLock().lock()`) before reading the shared resource.
- The `writeResource()` method acquires the **write lock** (`lock.writeLock().lock()`) before modifying the shared resource.
- Multiple reading threads (e.g., **Reader 1** and **Reader 2**) can access the resource simultaneously.
- Only one writing thread (e.g., **Writer**) can modify the resource, and it will block all reading threads until the write operation is done.

**`Example of Fair Lock`:**

You can create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` with fairness:

```java
ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true);  // true enables fair ordering
```

This ensures that threads are granted access to the lock in the order in which they requested it, preventing starvation of waiting threads.

# 5. `Semaphore`

A **`Semaphore`** in Java is a synchronization aid that allows controlling access to a shared resource by multiple threads. It is part of the **`java.util.concurrent`** package and can be used to limit the number of threads that can access a particular resource at the same time.

### `Concept`:
- A **Semaphore** maintains a set of permits. Threads can acquire permits before accessing the resource and must release them when done.
- If no permits are available, a thread attempting to acquire a permit will be blocked until a permit is released by another thread.

### `Types of Semaphore`:
1. **Counting Semaphore**: A semaphore that allows a specified number of threads to access the resource simultaneously.
2. **Binary Semaphore**: A special case of a semaphore with only one permit, acting like a mutual exclusion lock (similar to a `Lock` or a `synchronized` block).

### `Example Use Case`:
- Imagine a **parking lot** with only 5 parking spaces. A `Semaphore` with 5 permits can be used to control access. Only 5 cars can park at any time, and if all spots are taken, other cars have to wait until a space becomes free.

### `Semaphore Class in Java`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;
```

### `Constructor`:
- **`Semaphore(int permits)`**: Creates a semaphore with the given number of permits. If `permits = 1`, it behaves like a binary semaphore.
- **`Semaphore(int permits, boolean fair)`**: Creates a semaphore with the given number of permits and a fairness setting. When fairness is true, threads acquire permits in the order they requested (FIFO).

### Key Methods in `Semaphore`:
1. **`void acquire()`**: Acquires a permit from the semaphore, blocking if none are available.
2. **`void release()`**: Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore and allowing another waiting thread to proceed.
3. **`boolean tryAcquire()`**: Attempts to acquire a permit without blocking. Returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.
4. **`int availablePermits()`**: Returns the number of currently available permits.
   
### `Example`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

class ParkingLot {
    private final Semaphore semaphore;

    public ParkingLot(int slots) {
        // Create a semaphore with the given number of permits (parking spots)
        this.semaphore = new Semaphore(slots);
    }

    public void parkCar(String carName) {
        try {
            System.out.println(carName + " is trying to park.");
            semaphore.acquire();  // Try to acquire a parking spot
            System.out.println(carName + " has parked.");
            Thread.sleep(2000);  // Simulate parking time
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            System.out.println(carName + " is leaving.");
            semaphore.release();  // Release the parking spot
        }
    }
}

public class SemaphoreExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ParkingLot lot = new ParkingLot(2);  // Parking lot with 2 parking spots

        Runnable car = (name) -> {
            lot.parkCar(name.toString());
        };

        // Create 4 car threads trying to park in a 2-spot parking lot
        new Thread(() -> car.run("Car 1")).start();
        new Thread(() -> car.run("Car 2")).start();
        new Thread(() -> car.run("Car 3")).start();
        new Thread(() -> car.run("Car 4")).start();
    }
}
```

**`Output`**:

```java
Car 1 is trying to park.
Car 1 has parked.
Car 2 is trying to park.
Car 2 has parked.
Car 3 is trying to park.
Car 4 is trying to park.
Car 1 is leaving.
Car 3 has parked.
Car 2 is leaving.
Car 4 has parked.
```

### `Explanation`:
- The `ParkingLot` class uses a semaphore to limit the number of cars that can park at the same time.
- The `semaphore.acquire()` method is called when a car tries to park, and it blocks if no parking spots are available.
- Once a car leaves, the `semaphore.release()` method is called to make the spot available for another car.

### `Semaphore Characteristics`:
1. **`Permits`**: The number of permits limits the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously. Each thread must acquire a permit to proceed.
2. **`Blocking`**: If no permits are available, threads block until a permit is released.
3. **`Fairness`**: With a **fair semaphore** (`Semaphore(int permits, boolean fair)`), permits are granted in the order they were requested (FIFO). If fairness is not specified, the semaphore may not follow any order, potentially causing thread starvation.
4. **`Binary Semaphore`**: A special case where only one permit exists (like a mutex or lock), used to ensure exclusive access to a resource.

### `Advanced Methods`:
- **`drainPermits()`**: Acquires all permits available at the time and returns the number of permits drained.
- **`reducePermits(int reduction)`**: Reduces the number of permits by the specified amount (rarely used).

### `Use Cases`:
- **`Resource management`**: Controlling access to resources like database connections, network connections, or file systems.
- **`Rate limiting`**: Ensuring that only a specific number of requests or tasks are processed at once.
- **`Thread coordination`**: Semaphore can also be used for signaling between threads, similar to a `CountDownLatch`.
