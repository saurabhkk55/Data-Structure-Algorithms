# `Executor`

In Java, the Executor interface is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package, introduced in Java 5 to simplify task execution, decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run/execute (e.g., whether in a new thread, pooled thread, or in some other way).

Using Executor, a developer does not require to create Threads and manage them explicitly.

The **Executor interface** defines only *one method*:

```java
void execute(Runnable command);
```


### `Role of the execute() Method`:
The `execute()` method is designed to accept a `Runnable task` (which is essentially a unit of work) and execute it. The way the task is executed depends on the implementation of the Executor interface.

**or**

The `execute()` function in the Executor interface is responsible for submitting and potentially running Runnable tasks, leaving the exact details of execution (e.g., threading model) to the specific implementation of the Executor.

#### `Key Responsibilities`:
- **Task submission**: The method allows you to submit a Runnable task for execution.
- **Asynchronous execution**: The task might be executed asynchronously, depending on the executor's implementation. This means the caller doesn't have to manage the threads explicitly.
- **Thread management**: Different implementations of Executor may manage threads in different ways (e.g., creating new threads, reusing pooled threads).

### `Example Implementations of Executor`:
- **Direct execution:** In this case, the task is executed by the calling thread. The simplest implementation would be to just call run() on the Runnable:
  ```java
  class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
      public void execute(Runnable r) {
          r.run();  // Executes in the current thread
      }
  }
  ```
  
  
- **Thread-based execution:** In this case, the task is executed in a new thread:
  ```java
  class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
      public void execute(Runnable r) {
          new Thread(r).start();  // Executes in a new thread
      }
  }
  ```

- **Thread pool-based execution:** With thread pools, a task might be executed by an available thread in a pool, reusing threads for efficiency:
  java
  ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
  pool.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task executed in thread pool"));
  

### `Benefits of Using Executor Interface`:
- **Decoupling of task and execution mechanics:** The code that submits the task doesn't need to know how the task will be executed (in a new thread, in an existing thread pool, etc.).
- **Simplifies concurrency:** You can easily switch from using one execution strategy (e.g., new thread per task) to another (e.g., thread pool) by changing the Executor implementation without changing your core task code.

In summary, the `execute()` function in the Executor interface is responsible for submitting and potentially running Runnable tasks, leaving the exact details of execution (e.g., threading model) to the specific implementation of the Executor.

## `Detailed examples`:

### 1. `Direct Execution (DirectExecutor)`
In this implementation, the task is executed by the calling thread (synchronously).

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        // Executes the task directly in the calling thread
        command.run();
    }
}

public class DirectExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Executor directExecutor = new DirectExecutor();

        // Submitting a task for execution
        directExecutor.execute(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task is executed by the calling thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Task is executed by the calling thread: main
```
Here, the `Runnable task` is executed on the thread that called the `execute()` method (in this case, the `main thread`).

### 2. `Thread-Per-Task Execution (ThreadPerTaskExecutor)`
In this implementation, a new thread is created for each task.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        // Creates a new thread for each task
        new Thread(command).start();
    }
}

public class ThreadPerTaskExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Executor threadPerTaskExecutor = new ThreadPerTaskExecutor();

        // Submitting a task for execution
        threadPerTaskExecutor.execute(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task is executed in a new thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Task is executed in a new thread: Thread-0
```

Here, a new thread is created and started for each Runnable task that is submitted.

### 3. `Thread Pool Execution (FixedThreadPool)`
In this implementation, tasks are executed using a fixed-size thread pool. Instead of creating a new thread for every task, threads are reused to improve efficiency.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creates a fixed-size thread pool of 2 threads
        ExecutorService threadPoolExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Submitting multiple tasks for execution
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            threadPoolExecutor.execute(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is executed by thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shutdown the executor to stop accepting new tasks
        threadPoolExecutor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Task 0 is executed by thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 1 is executed by thread: pool-1-thread-2
Task 2 is executed by thread: pool-1-thread-1
Task 3 is executed by thread: pool-1-thread-2
Task 4 is executed by thread: pool-1-thread-1
```

Here, the Runnable tasks are executed by two reusable threads from the pool (pool-1-thread-1 and pool-1-thread-2).

### Explanation of Key Points:
1. *DirectExecutor*: The task runs on the current thread. No new threads are created.
2. *ThreadPerTaskExecutor*: A new thread is created for every task, leading to potentially unbounded thread creation.
3. *Thread Pool Execution*: Tasks are executed by a limited number of reusable threads from a pool, which optimizes resource usage.
