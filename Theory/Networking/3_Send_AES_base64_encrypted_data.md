### Question:

IF I AM SENDING ENCRYPTED DATA USING aes IT WILL FUTHER ENCODED OVER INTERNETE AS I AM USING HTTPS?

### Answer:

Yes, the data you are sending using AES encryption will be further secured when transmitted over HTTPS, but the mechanisms of encryption are different. Here's how it works:

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

1. **AES Encryption (Client Side)**:
    - You encrypt the data using **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** on the client side.
    - This encryption ensures that the data you send (like sensitive information) is **confidential** even if someone intercepts it.
    - The AES encryption will **only** decrypt properly with the corresponding **key** on the receiving end (server).

2. **Sending Encrypted Data Over HTTPS**:
    - You send the **already encrypted AES data** over HTTPS to the server.
    - HTTPS (which uses **TLS**) provides **encryption at the transport layer**. TLS encrypts the entire **communication channel** between the client and server, protecting all data sent over that channel (including your already AES-encrypted data).

3. **How HTTPS Works**:
    - When the data is sent over HTTPS, it is **encrypted twice**:
        1. **First Layer**: The **AES-encrypted data** remains as is, with its own encryption.
        2. **Second Layer**: The entire HTTP request (including the AES-encrypted data) is **further encrypted** by **TLS/SSL**.

   This means that HTTPS provides an additional **secure layer** on top of your already encrypted AES data, ensuring **confidentiality** and **integrity** during transmission.

4. **TLS Encryption**:
    - **TLS encryption** (the basis of HTTPS) provides end-to-end encryption between the **client and server**. This encryption uses a different method (such as **RSA**, **ECDSA**, or **Diffie-Hellman**) and is primarily used to protect the transmission of data over the network.
    - TLS encrypts the **entire communication** between the client and server, ensuring that any data sent (including the already AES-encrypted data) is protected from interception, tampering, and eavesdropping during transit.

### **Summary of the Process**:

- **Client Side**:
    - You encrypt sensitive data using **AES**.
    - You send the AES-encrypted data over an **HTTPS** connection to the server.

- **Transport Layer** (HTTPS/TLS Encryption):
    - The **TLS layer** encrypts the entire HTTP request (including the AES-encrypted data) while in transit.
    - This ensures that no one can read or modify the data during transit, even if they intercept the network traffic.

- **Server Side**:
    - The server receives the encrypted data and **decrypts it using AES** (because the server knows the AES key).
    - The server then processes the decrypted data.

### **To Clarify**:

- **AES** is responsible for **encrypting the actual data** (like passwords, messages, or other sensitive information).
- **HTTPS** (TLS) is responsible for **securing the channel** between the client and server to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

### **What Happens During Transmission**:
- Your AES-encrypted data is **first encrypted** using **TLS** when sent over HTTPS.
- On the client side, the data is encrypted with **AES** and then **wrapped** in TLS encryption for transport.
- On the server side, **TLS decrypts** the message first (to access the encrypted payload), and then the server can decrypt the payload using **AES** with the corresponding decryption key.

This provides **double encryption**:
1. **AES encryption** (data confidentiality).
2. **TLS encryption** (secure transport).

Both are important for ensuring that the data remains secure throughout the entire communication process.
