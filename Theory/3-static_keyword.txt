Static keyword
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.
We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

Q) Why is the Java main method static?
Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

3) Java static block
Is used to initialize the static data member.
It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
Example of static block
class A2{  
  static{System.out.println("static block is invoked");}  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
	System.out.println("Hello main");  
  }  
}  
Output:static block is invoked
       Hello main

Q) Can we execute a program without main() method?
Ans) No, one of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a Java class without the main method.

class A3{  
  static{  
	  System.out.println("static block is invoked");  
	  System.exit(0);  
  }  
}  

Output:
static block is invoked
Since JDK 1.7 and above, output would be:
Error: Main method not found in class A3, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
