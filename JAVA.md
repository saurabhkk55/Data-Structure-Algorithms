Q1) First we define dependency in the pom.xml, then maven loads the library(JAR fil) into the class path and then only we use it inside the code via annotation, is it correct?

A1) Yes, your understanding is correct! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

### **1. Defining Dependencies in `pom.xml`**
In a Spring Boot application, you start by defining the necessary dependencies in the `pom.xml` file if you are using Maven. This file specifies which libraries (JAR files) your application needs to function. For example, you might include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, or any other libraries required for your application.

### **2. Maven Loads the Libraries**
Once you have defined the dependencies, Maven takes care of downloading the specified libraries and their transitive dependencies from the Maven Central Repository. These libraries are then added to the classpath of your application, making them available for use.

### **3. Using Libraries in Code**
After the libraries are loaded into the classpath, you can utilize them in your code. In Spring Boot, this is often done through annotations. For instance, you might use `@RestController` to define a RESTful web service or `@Autowired` to inject dependencies into your classes. This annotation-based configuration simplifies the process of wiring components together and managing dependencies.
