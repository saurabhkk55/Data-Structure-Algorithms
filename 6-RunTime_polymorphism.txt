Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

Upcasting
If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as upcasting. For example:
class A{}  
class B extends A{}  
A a=new B();//upcasting  

Since method invocation is determined by the JVM not compiler, it is known as runtime polymorphism

Example of Java Runtime Polymorphism
In this example, we are creating two classes Bike and Splendor. Splendor class extends Bike class and overrides its run() method. We are calling the run method by the reference variable of Parent class. Since it refers to the subclass object and subclass method overrides the Parent class method, the subclass method is invoked at runtime.

class Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running");}  
}  
class Splendor extends Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 60km");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike b = new Splendor();//upcasting  
    b.run();  
  }  
}  
Output:
running safely with 60km.
